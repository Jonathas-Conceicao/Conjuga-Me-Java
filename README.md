## Conjugations of portuguese verbs on terminal
  The conjugations are taken from http://www.conjuga-me.net/ but I have **no** no relation with it.

### Instalation
  Run the install script(may need sudo) and follow the procedure to install the software.

### Usage
  After installing a executable will be made under the name **conjugame**.  
  Call the executable and pass the verbs you want to get the conjugations from. Use *man conjugame* for more info.

### Screenshots
Verbs's conjugations appear in highlighted

Irregular conjugations have different highlight.
